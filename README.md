# Guncel-Televizyon-UWP

IPTV application for Windows 10.

This is the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) port of my side-project GÃ¼ncel Televizyon.

It's still under development and missing detailed techincal informaton.However , here are some basics :

* It's a UWP project and working on all Windows 10 devices.
* 8.1 version of the project were using PhoneSM to be able to play HLS streams.This one doesn't need to because HLS streams are now supported on Windows 10 by default.
* Project is being developed with Prism , so basically everything is MVVM based.
* Missing a web api atm.Currently working with dummy models and datas.
